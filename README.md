Hiya! This is my website for short snippets of code that I'll be exploring and working on over the next year. With this project I aim to document two goals I have for the upcoming year

- start to introduce myself to algorithmic computer coding
- learn a lot more about lower-level languages such as C, C++ and Java
- and begin having fun with languages such as Assembly

I come from a bit-of-everything background with lots of experience in a ton of different areas â€” virtualisation, full stack programming, networking, sysadmin, hardware, (hard-drives), *nix, low-level silicon, Android fun, and a lot more. But since I'm a big boi now I'd like to try my hand at some stuff I never really had the need to learn about. That would be um... that stuff I mentioned above :D

Some challenges I anticipate:

- A lot of these low-level, abstract concepts are going to require maths (specifically, stuff you'll find in the NSW Ext.1, Ext.2 syllabus and possibly even uni-level maths). Last year (when I was 15) we were doing quadratic formula. I'll probably need to know a little bit more for a rookie attempt at big boi computer science
- oh yea school... i'll be lucky if I get the time to work on this once a month
- err maybe I'm not smart enough? Eh I guess we'll find out

Since I'm a relative newbie to all of this (and though I hope my past experience will help, compsci is a completely different beast - like how you can play classical or rock music on the piano) I'll be taking it pretty easy. I'll probably start out with analysing code in languages I'm familiar with: annotating, modifying and playing it - and making notes on the mathematical concepts behind it. I'll then try and pick up some new languages - while I have experience with C++, C and Java are somewhat foreign to me (I haven't written any before - just looked at it with a blanked face). Eventually, I want to start learning Assembly language and making a cool program with that.

This is a low-priority project for me and you can expect for it to be abandoned soon enough, but maybe I'll have some fun with it for a while.
