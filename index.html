        this is adrian's repository of his new stupid adventures in computer science. this is literally extra maths why
        am i doing this...

    Hiya! This is my website for short snippets of code that I'll be exploring and working on over the next year. With
    this project I aim to document two goals I have for the upcoming year

    <ul>
        <li>start to introduce myself to algorithmic computer coding</li>
        <li>learn about low-level languages such as C, C++ and Java</li>
        <li>and begin fiddling with near-machine code such as Assembly</li>
    </ul>

    I come from a bit-of-everything background with lots of experience in a ton of different areas â€” virtualisation,
    full stack programming, networking, sysadmin, hardware, low-level silicon, Android fun, and a lot more. But since
    I'm a big boi now I'd like to try my hand at some stuff I never really had the need to learn about. That would be
    um... that stuff I mentioned above :D
    <br><br>
    Some challenges I anticipate:
    <ul>
        <li>A lot of these low-level, abstract concepts are going to require maths (specifically, stuff you'll find in
            the NSW
            Ext.1, Ext.2 syllabus and possibly even uni-level maths). Last year (when I was 15) we were doing quadratic
            formula.
            I'll probably need to know a little bit more for a rookie attempt at big boi computer science</li>
        <li>oh yea school... i'll be lucky if I get the time to work on this once a month</li>
        <li>err maybe I'm not smart enough? Eh I guess we'll find out</li>
    </ul>

    Since I'm a relative newbie to all of this (and though I hope my past experience will help, compsci is a completely
    different beast - like how you can play classical or rock music on the piano) I'll be taking it pretty easy. I'll
    probably start out with analysing code in languages I'm familiar with: annotating, modifying and playing it - and
    making notes on the mathematical concepts behind it. I'll then try and pick up some new languages - while I have
    experience with C++, C and Java are somewhat foreign to me (I haven't written any before - just looked at it with a
    blanked face). Eventually, I want to start learning Assembly language and making a cool program with that.
    <br><br>
    This is a low-priority project for me and you can expect for it to be abandoned soon enough, but maybe I'll have
    some fun with it for a while.
