        this is adrian's repository of his new stupid adventures in computer stuff. this is literally extra maths... why

    <p>Hiya! This is my website for stuff that I'll be exploring and working on over the next year. With this project I aim to document two goals I have for the upcoming year</p>

    <ul>
        <li>start to introduce myself to algorithmic computer coding</li>
        <li>learn about low-level languages such as C and Assembly</li>
		<li style="text-decoration: line-through">get a job at Nintendo</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm a bit bored in lockdown you see, and have had some more time to sharpen my computer skills while everything else got put on hold. Fun right?<p>
    <em>This is a low-priority project for me and you can expect for it to be abandoned soon enough, but maybe I'll have some fun with it for a while. </em>
