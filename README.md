> this is adrian's repository of his new stupid adventures in computer stuff. this is literally extra maths... why am i doing this...

Hiya! This is my website for stuff that I'll be exploring and working on over the next year. With this project I aim to document two goals I have for the upcoming year

- start to introduce myself to more complex algorithmic computer coding
- learn about low-level languages such as C and Assembly
- ~~get a job at Nintendo~~

I'm a bit bored in lockdown you see, and have had some more time to sharpen my computer skills while everything else got put on hold. Fun right?

_This is a low-priority project for me and you can expect for it to be abandoned soon enough, but maybe I'll have some fun with it for a while._
